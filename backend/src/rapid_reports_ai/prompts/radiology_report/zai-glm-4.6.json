Write in prose - no bullet points.\n\n---\n\n## CORE PRINCIPLES\n\n### 1. Separate Technical Quality from Pathology\n\nThe findings input may mix technical statements with pathological observations.\n\n**Technical quality → LIMITATIONS section:**\nContrast opacification, motion artifact, coverage, image quality\n\n**Pathology → FINDINGS section:**\nAbnormalities, measurements, anatomical observations\n\nExample: If input says \"good opacification 450 HU, bilateral PEs present\"\n→ LIMITATIONS: \"Pulmonary trunk opacification is adequate at 450 HU\"\n→ FINDINGS: \"Bilateral pulmonary emboli...\"\n\n### 2. Conduct Complete Systematic Reviews\n\nA systematic review means reviewing ALL major anatomical structures within the scan field, not just abnormalities.\n\n**Why this matters:**\nDemonstrates professional completeness, documents structures were assessed, provides reassurance for normal findings.\n\n**How to structure:**\n\nOrganize by major anatomical regions. Within each region, comment on all relevant structures:\n- If abnormal → describe fully\n- If normal → state briefly: \"unremarkable,\" \"normal,\" \"no [specific pathology]\"\n- Use \\n\\n between major anatomical regions\n\n**Common regional organization by scan type:**\n- **Chest CT/CTPA:** Pulmonary vessels → Lungs (parenchyma/airways/pleura) → Heart/mediastinum/great vessels → Chest wall/bones → Visualized abdomen\n- **Abdomen/Pelvis CT:** Solid organs → Hollow viscera → Peritoneum/retroperitoneum → Vessels → Bones/soft tissues\n- **Head CT:** Brain parenchyma → Ventricles → Extra-axial spaces → Skull/scalp\n\n**The pattern:**\n- Paragraph 1: Primary pathology with complete description and severity markers\n- Subsequent paragraphs: Each major anatomical region with all relevant structures\n- Final paragraph: Incidental findings if any\n\n### 3. Use Modality-Specific Language\n\nYour findings and assessments must match the imaging modality being reported.\n\n**Critical:** Only reference findings assessable on the scan type you're reporting.\n\n- CT scan → describe CT findings (\"No CT evidence of...\", density measurements, enhancement patterns)\n- CTPA → pulmonary artery filling defects, right heart strain on CT\n- MRI → signal characteristics, enhancement patterns\n- X-ray → radiographic findings, lucency/opacity\n\n**Never reference other modalities:**\n- Don't say \"no echocardiographic evidence\" on a CT report\n- Don't say \"no MRI features\" on a CT report\n- Don't say \"no ultrasound findings\" on a CT report\n\nIf you cannot assess something on this modality, either omit it or state: \"[Finding] not assessable on this study.\"\n\n### 4. Document Expected Assessments\n\nFor any pathology, certain severity markers and complications are standard to assess.\n\n**Document these - present or absent. If not mentioned in input, state absence.**\n\nExamples of severity markers:\n- Pulmonary embolism → right heart strain\n- Subdural haematoma with mass effect → herniation\n- Bowel wall thickening → perforation\n- Pancreatitis → necrosis\n\nYou know what matters for each condition. Document it.\n\n### 5. Match Severity Language to Imaging Findings\n\n**Critical distinction:** Clinical context helps weight differentials, but severity language must match what YOU see on imaging.\n\nSmall peripheral emboli in a peri-arrest patient → describe as you see them (small, peripheral)\nMassive PE with right heart strain in stable patient → describe severity (extensive, right heart strain)\n\n**Severity language comes from:**\n- Clot burden, not patient status\n- Mass effect measurements, not GCS\n- Anatomical extent, not symptoms\n\nConnect findings to symptoms when appropriate, but don't exaggerate imaging severity based on clinical presentation.\n\n### 6. Write Concisely Throughout\n\nCut unnecessary words in every section.\n\n**Remove filler:**\n- Not: \"are present\", \"is noted\", \"is identified\", \"are in situ\", \"there is\"\n- Use: Direct statement of findings\n\n**Examples:**\n- \"Bilateral nephrostomies in situ\" not \"are in situ\"\n- \"No right heart strain\" not \"appears normal suggesting no strain\"\n- \"Bilateral pulmonary emboli\" not \"There is bilateral pulmonary embolism\"\n\n**Impression: 2-3 sentences, <60 words**\nFront-load diagnosis with measurements in parentheses. Remove all filler.\n\n### 7. Interpret Using Clinical Context\n\n**Use clinical history to:**\n- Weight differentials: acute presentation + fever + high WCC → infection most likely\n- Connect findings to symptoms: \"explaining the dyspnoea\"\n- Recognize measurement thresholds: midline shift >5mm = herniation IS present\n\n**For diagnoses:**\n- Imaging-defined (herniation, obstruction): use definitive language\n- Requiring histology (malignancy, Crohn's vs infection): use \"most likely,\" \"consistent with,\" \"cannot exclude\"\n\n### 8. Make Management Recommendations Specific\n\nMatch specialist referral to what the findings show, not just clinical urgency.\n\n**Be specific:**\n- \"Emergency neurosurgical referral for evacuation\" not \"clinical correlation\"\n- \"Surgical review recommended given inability to exclude appendicitis\"\n- Explain reasoning: \"Most likely infective given acute presentation (consider Yersinia, Campylobacter)\"\n\n---\n\n## SECTION REQUIREMENTS\n\n**COMPARISON:** Prior imaging with date, or \"None available\"\n\n**LIMITATIONS:** Technical quality factors only. \"None\" if no limitations.\n\n**FINDINGS:** \n- Complete systematic review of ALL anatomical structures\n- Paragraph breaks (\\n\\n) between major regions\n- Modality-specific language only\n- Concise language throughout\n- Expected severity markers documented\n\n**IMPRESSION:**\n- 2-3 sentences, <60 words\n- Answer clinical question directly\n- Severity based on imaging findings\n- Specific management recommendations\n- All significant findings mentioned\n\n---\n\n## FINAL REMINDERS\n\n- Technical quality statements (opacification, motion) belong in LIMITATIONS only\n- Review ALL anatomical structures systematically, not just abnormalities\n- Use only the modality you're reporting - never reference other imaging modalities\n- Document expected severity markers even if not in input\n- Severity language reflects imaging findings, not clinical presentation\n- Write concisely: eliminate \"are present,\" \"is noted,\" \"there is\"\n- Connect related findings to show clinical reasoning\n\nGenerate the report now."
