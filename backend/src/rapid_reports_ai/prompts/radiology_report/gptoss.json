    "template": "=== CASE DATA ===\n<scan_type>{{SCAN_TYPE}}</scan_type>\n<clinical_history>{{CLINICAL_HISTORY}}</clinical_history>\n<findings>{{FINDINGS}}</findings>\n\n=== PHASE 1: CLINICAL REASONING ===\n\nSystematically analyze the case before writing:\n\n**INPUT ANALYSIS**\n• Scan type and protocol: {{SCAN_TYPE}}\n• Clinical question: What is being asked from <clinical_history>?\n• Prior imaging: Extract modality, date, region (if mentioned in <findings>)\n• Limitations: Technical factors affecting interpretation (if any)\n\n**FINDINGS MAPPING**\nFor each finding in <findings>:\n1. Is this finding valid for {{SCAN_TYPE}}? (e.g., CT non-contrast cannot show enhancement, CT cannot describe signal intensity, MRI cannot describe attenuation)\n2. Clinical significance: Urgent/significant vs incidental?\n3. Which anatomical region/system?\n4. Key differentials?\n5. Pertinent negatives relevant to these differentials?\n\n**ANATOMICAL SCOPE**\nList ALL anatomical regions visible on {{SCAN_TYPE}} including scan extremities (e.g., lower thorax on abdominal CT, upper abdomen on chest CT).\n\n**STRUCTURE PLANNING**\n\nPATHOLOGY PARAGRAPHS (if pathology present):\n• Paragraph 1: [pathology name] → immediate complications → pertinent negatives → affected structures\n• Paragraph 2: [if additional pathology] → ...\n\nREMAINING ANATOMY PARAGRAPHS:\n• Group 1: [System, e.g., \"solid organs\"] → 1-2 sentences covering liver, spleen, pancreas, etc.\n• Group 2: [System, e.g., \"hollow viscera\"] → 1-2 sentences covering bowel, bladder, etc.\n• Target: Maximum 2-3 sentences per group\n\nVERIFICATION CHECKLIST (CHECK BEFORE WRITING):\n□ All regions from anatomical scope covered?\n□ Each structure mentioned only ONCE?\n□ Pertinent negatives integrated WITH pathology (not repeated separately)?\n□ Related normal structures grouped together?\n\n**IMPRESSION PLANNING**\n• Main diagnostic conclusion: [one sentence]\n• Significant/actionable incidentals ONLY (those requiring intervention, follow-up, or referral): [if any, one sentence or omit]\n• Recommendation (only if non-obvious): [one sentence or omit]\n\nEXCLUDE: Benign incidentals below action threshold (simple cysts, benign haemangiomas, etc. that require no follow-up)\n\n=== PHASE 2: REPORT GENERATION ===\n\nGenerate the report following these 5 CRITICAL RULES:\n\n**RULE 1: ONE MENTION ONLY**\nEach anatomical structure appears ONCE in the entire report.\n\n❌ BAD: \"The liver is unremarkable. ... The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.\"\n\n**RULE 2: GROUP, DON'T LIST**\nCombine related normal structures into single sentences.\n\n❌ BAD: \"The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable. The pancreas is unremarkable.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"The solid abdominal organs are unremarkable.\"\n\n**RULE 3: INTEGRATE PERTINENT NEGATIVES**\nPertinent negatives belong WITH the pathology they relate to, not separately.\n\n❌ BAD: \"There is a 3 cm liver lesion. No biliary dilatation. No ascites. ... [Later:] The bile ducts are not dilated.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"There is a 3 cm liver lesion without biliary dilatation or ascites.\"\n\n**RULE 4: SENTENCE LENGTH LIMITS**\n• Pathology sentences: Maximum 30 words\n• Normal anatomy sentences: Maximum 20 words\n• If describing complex pathology, use 2 shorter sentences instead of 1 long sentence\n\n**RULE 5: IMPRESSION = DIAGNOSIS + ACTION ONLY**\nImpression is 1-2 sentences in prose format (NOT bullet points):\n• Main diagnostic conclusion or differential diagnosis\n• Significant/actionable incidental findings ONLY (those requiring intervention, follow-up, referral, or with malignant potential)\n• Recommendations (only if non-obvious: MDT, biopsy, interval imaging, urgent referral)\n\nDO NOT include benign incidentals below action threshold (e.g., simple renal cysts <1cm, small liver haemangiomas, benign-appearing nodules that require no follow-up).\n\nCRITICAL: State conclusions DIRECTLY. Do NOT use explanatory phrases like \"indicating\", \"demonstrating\", \"consistent with\", \"suggesting\" - these add verbosity. Do NOT restate what was already said - if you said \"no metastases\", don't add \"indicating no metastatic disease\".\n\n❌ BAD: \"Unremarkable liver. Small simple renal cyst measuring 8 mm. Recommend clinical correlation.\"\n❌ BAD: \"No acute abdominal pathology. Benign simple renal cyst requires no follow-up.\" (benign incidental below threshold - should not be in impression)\n❌ BAD: \"No pulmonary metastases or mediastinal lymphadenopathy identified, indicating no evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\" (redundant - \"indicating\" phrase restates what was already said)\n✅ GOOD: \"No acute abdominal pathology identified.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"No evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\" (concise, direct conclusion)\n✅ GOOD: \"Right upper lobe nodule with suspicious features, requires interval CT follow-up in 3 months.\" (actionable incidental)\n\n---\n\n**EXEMPLAR REPORTS**\n\nExample 1 - CT Abdomen Pelvis (Normal):\n\n**Comparison:**\nNo previous imaging available for comparison.\n\n**Findings:**\nThe solid abdominal organs, adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with no hydronephrosis or calculi. The gallbladder, bile ducts and appendix are normal. Bowel loops are normal calibre without wall thickening. The abdominal aorta is normal calibre. No lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\n\n**Impression:**\nNo acute abdominal pathology identified.\n\n---\n\nExample 2 - CT Head (Pathology):\n\n**Comparison:**\nCT head 12/10/2024 showed 15 mm right MCA territory infarct.\n\n**Findings:**\nThe previously documented right MCA territory infarct demonstrates expected evolution with established low attenuation and mild mass effect on the frontal horn. No haemorrhagic transformation. No new ischaemic territory. The remainder of the brain parenchyma shows no acute abnormality. The basal cisterns are patent. No extra-axial collection.\n\n**Impression:**\nEvolving right MCA territory infarct without haemorrhagic transformation or new ischaemic territory. MDT discussion recommended for secondary prevention strategy.\n\n---\n\nExample 3 - CT Chest (Multiple Findings):\n\n**Comparison:**\nCT chest 03/09/2024 showed 6 mm right upper lobe nodule.\n\n**Findings:**\nThe previously noted right upper lobe nodule has increased to 9 mm with spiculated margins and adjacent pleural thickening, concerning for malignancy. No other pulmonary nodules or consolidation. The mediastinum shows enlarged right paratracheal lymph nodes measuring up to 15 mm short axis. The heart and great vessels are unremarkable. No pleural or pericardial effusion.\n\n**Impression:**\nProgressing right upper lobe nodule with suspicious features and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, highly concerning for primary lung malignancy. Urgent respiratory MDT referral and tissue diagnosis recommended.\n\n---\n\n**COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:**\n\n❌ **Redundancy (same structure mentioned multiple times):**\n\"The liver is unremarkable in appearance. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The spleen appears normal. The pancreas is unremarkable in appearance. The adrenal glands are unremarkable.\"\n\n✅ **Corrected (grouped efficiently):**\n\"The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.\"\n\n---\n\n❌ **Pertinent negatives repeated separately:**\n\"There is a 4 cm liver lesion. The bile ducts are not dilated. ... [Later in report:] No biliary dilatation.\"\n\n✅ **Corrected (integrated once):**\n\"There is a 4 cm hepatic lesion without biliary dilatation or vascular involvement.\"\n\n---\n\n❌ **Verbose impression with descriptive content:**\n\"There is a small 3 mm simple renal cyst in keeping with a benign finding. The liver lesion demonstrates features in keeping with a haemangioma. Clinical correlation is recommended.\"\n\n❌ **Impression includes benign incidentals below threshold:**\n\"Benign hepatic haemangioma and simple renal cyst, no follow-up required.\" (These benign findings should stay in Findings only, not in Impression)\n\n✅ **Corrected (diagnostic conclusions only, no benign incidentals):**\n\"No acute abdominal pathology identified.\" (If no significant pathology, keep impression brief)\n✅ **Corrected (actionable incidental only):**\n\"Right upper lobe nodule measuring 8 mm, requires interval CT follow-up in 3 months per Fleischner guidelines.\" (Actionable incidental requiring follow-up - appropriate for impression)\n\n---\n\n❌ **Long sentences (>30 words for pathology):**\n\"The liver demonstrates a 4.2 cm heterogeneous lesion in segment 7 which shows arterial phase enhancement and delayed washout with a pseudocapsule appearance and there is no biliary dilatation or vascular invasion identified.\"\n\n✅ **Corrected (split into focused sentences):**\n\"The liver demonstrates a 4.2 cm segment 7 lesion with arterial enhancement, delayed washout and pseudocapsule formation. No biliary dilatation or vascular invasion.\"\n\n---\n\n❌ **Verbose impression with redundant explanatory phrases:**\n\"No pulmonary metastases or mediastinal lymphadenopathy identified, indicating no evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\"\n\n✅ **Corrected (direct conclusion, no redundancy):**\n\"No evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\"\n\n---\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT**\n\nGenerate valid JSON with three fields:\n{\n  \"report_content\": \"Complete report following structure: Comparison → Limitations (if applicable) → Findings → Impression\",\n  \"description\": \"5-15 word clinical summary (max 150 chars, exclude scan type)\",\n  \"scan_type\": \"From input, include contrast status ONLY if explicitly stated\"\n}\n\n**REPORT FORMATTING**\n• Bold section headers: **Comparison:**, **Limitations:**, **Findings:**, **Impression:**\n• Double line breaks between sections\n• Single line breaks between paragraphs within Findings\n• Impression: Prose format (flowing sentences), NOT bullet points\n• No XML tags, prompt references, or markdown in report content\n\n**COMPARISON TERMINOLOGY**\nTemporal terms (stable/unchanged/new/increased) require explicit comparison evidence in input. Without priors: use \"acute\" for emergency presentations, neutral language otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**BEFORE OUTPUTTING - MANDATORY SELF-CHECK:**\n\n□ Did I mention any anatomical structure more than once? (Re-read and verify)\n□ Are all sentences under the word limit? (Count: pathology ≤30 words, normal anatomy ≤20 words)\n□ Is my impression diagnostic conclusions only? (No descriptive details from Findings, no benign incidentals below threshold, no redundant explanatory phrases like \"indicating\" or \"demonstrating\")\n□ Did I group related normal structures together? (Not listed individually)\n□ Are pertinent negatives integrated WITH pathology? (Not repeated separately)\n\nIf you found ANY issues in this self-check, FIX THEM NOW before outputting JSON.\n\n=== GENERATE REPORT NOW ==="
