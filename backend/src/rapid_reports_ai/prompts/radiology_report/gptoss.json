What's the differential diagnosis?\n- What's urgent/significant vs incidental?\n- What recommendations or follow-up needed?\n\n**Impression Synthesis Strategy:**\n- Can multiple findings be expressed as one diagnostic entity?\n- What's the irreducible diagnostic conclusion stripping all descriptive detail?\n- **Related Findings Analysis:**\n  • Are these findings manifestations of the same underlying pathology or disease process?\n  • If yes: Consolidate into single diagnostic statement - do NOT create separate lines for related manifestations\n  • If no: They may warrant separate lines only if they represent distinct urgent pathologies requiring different management\n- **Incidental Finding Triage:**\n  • INCLUDE if: requires urgent action, has malignant potential, needs specific follow-up/referral, at intervention threshold\n  • OMIT if: benign and common, below action thresholds, requires no follow-up, adequately noted in Findings\n  • Decision rule: If it doesn't change immediate management or require urgent action, it doesn't belong in Impression\n- How many lines needed? Simple case = 1-2 short lines; complex = 2-3 as justified\n- Remove every removable word: state diagnosis directly, avoid hedging, omit non-threshold measurements\n\n**Step 5: Report Structure Planning & Comparison Evidence Check**\n\n- Comparison statement: Is there prior imaging mentioned? If yes, note the modality and anatomical region it covers\n\n- Limitations: Any technical limitations mentioned?\n\n- Findings paragraphs: Group by anatomical region\n\n- Impression bullets: Prioritize by clinical importance\n\n**CRITICAL - Comparison Evidence Verification:**\n\nFor EACH significant finding that will appear in Impression:\n\n1. Verify: \"Is THIS SPECIFIC FINDING explicitly described with comparison terminology in <findings>?\"\n\n   - Comparison indicators: unchanged, stable, as previously seen, increased, decreased, new, interval change, compared to, persists\n\n2. If explicit comparison exists → Use matching terminology in Impression\n\n3. If NO comparison exists → Assess clinical context:\n\n   - Acute clinical presentation → Describe as acute or new\n\n   - Chronic or incidental finding → Use neutral descriptive language only\n\n   - NEVER apply temporal comparison terms without explicit evidence in <findings>\n\n</reasoning>\n\n=== PHASE 2: REPORT GENERATION ===\n\nNow generate the structured radiology report following these requirements:\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nValid JSON with three fields:\n- \"report_content\": Complete radiology report with proper formatting\n- \"description\": Brief 5-15 word summary for history tab (max 150 characters, exclude scan type)\n- \"scan_type\": Extract from <scan_type> with contrast status only if explicitly stated\n\n**REPORT STRUCTURE - MANDATORY SECTION ORDER:**\n\n1. **Comparison:** (Always first)\n   - Extract from <findings> (keywords: \"comparison\", \"previous\", \"prior\")\n   - Format: \"Previous [modality] [region] dated [date]\" OR \"No previous imaging available for comparison\"\n   - Bold header: **Comparison:**\n\n2. **Limitations:** (Only if technical limitations exist in <findings>, otherwise OMIT)\n   - Must come BEFORE Findings if present\n   - Bold header: **Limitations:**\n\n3. **Findings:** (Must come AFTER Limitations if present)\n   - Bold header: **Findings:**\n   - OBSERVATIONAL ONLY - what you see, not what it means\n   - **Note: Apply these principles where template is silent; template structure and instructions take precedence**\n   - **Break into MULTIPLE paragraphs by logical anatomical groupings**\n   - Single line breaks (\\n) between paragraphs within Findings\n   - Within each paragraph: positive findings first, then relevant negatives for that region\n   - Start directly with anatomy: \"The liver...\", \"There is...\", \"No...\"\n   - DO NOT start with: \"The CT demonstrates...\", \"On this scan...\", \"Imaging shows...\"\n   - Group related structures: \"The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable\"\n   - Do NOT group unrelated regions: NOT \"The mediastinum, liver, adrenals and bones are unremarkable\"\n   - Each structure mentioned ONCE only - consolidate all information\n   - Use correct modality language:\n     • CT: density, attenuation, Hounsfield units\n     • MRI: signal intensity, T1/T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI\n   - **CRITICAL: Do NOT dump all normal findings into one massive sentence - distribute across appropriate paragraphs**\n   - NEVER duplicate information about the same structure\n\n4. **Impression:** (Always last)\n   - Bold header: **Impression:**\n   - **LENGTH**: As concise as possible while diagnostically precise\n     • Target: 1-2 lines maximum\n     • Complex cases: 2-3 lines only if multiple unrelated urgent pathologies requiring distinct management\n     • If you have 3+ lines, STOP and reconsider: Are you listing related findings separately? Including incidentals? Over-segmenting?\n   \n   - **CONTENT PRINCIPLES**:\n     • Synthesize findings into diagnoses, don't list observations\n     • State conclusions directly - avoid \"suggestive of\" unless genuinely uncertain\n     • First line: Diagnostic conclusion answering clinical question\n     • Second line (if urgent action needed): Specific actionable recommendation\n     • Remove all deletable words: verbose qualifiers, non-threshold measurements, hedging language\n     • One focused concept per line - don't mix unrelated findings\n   \n   - **RELATED FINDINGS CONSOLIDATION**:\n     • Findings that are manifestations of the same pathology = ONE diagnostic statement\n     • Do NOT create separate lines for related manifestations of the same disease process\n     • If findings are truly unrelated urgent pathologies requiring different management, they may warrant separate lines\n     • Question: \"Are these separate diseases or manifestations of one process?\"\n   \n   - **ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS IN IMPRESSION**:\n     Include when: Urgent intervention required (biopsy, surgery, drain, referral), specific follow-up imaging needed (with timeframe/modality), immediate management change required\n     Format: Be specific - \"Urgent colonoscopic biopsy and oncologic MDT referral recommended\" not \"Clinical correlation recommended\"\n     Omit: Generic phrases (\"clinical correlation\", \"further evaluation\" without specifics) unless genuinely uncertain about diagnosis\n     Critical: Do NOT omit urgent recommendations (e.g., biopsy for suspected malignancy, chest drain for tension pneumothorax, urgent MDT referral)\n     \n     **Scope of Practice - Radiologist Recommendations:**\n     Within scope: Further imaging (specify modality/timeframe), urgent clinical review/referral to specific teams, tissue diagnosis (biopsy), immediate radiological interventions (drains, urgent MDT)\n     Beyond scope: Medication changes (starting/stopping drugs), definitive treatment decisions, clinical management beyond imaging\n     Format recommendations appropriately:\n       • \"Recommend urgent respiratory team review\" NOT \"Recommend cessation of methotrexate\"\n       • \"Recommend high-resolution CT for further characterisation\" NOT \"Recommend drug cessation and HRCT\"\n       • \"Findings raise concern for drug toxicity; recommend clinical correlation\" NOT \"Stop medication\"\n   \n   - **INCIDENTAL FINDINGS IN IMPRESSION**:\n     Include only if: requires urgent action, has malignant potential, needs specific follow-up/referral, at intervention threshold\n     Omit if: benign and common, below action thresholds, no follow-up needed\n     Decision rule: If it doesn't change immediate management, it doesn't belong in Impression\n     If a finding requires only routine surveillance or no further work-up, it belongs in Findings section, not Impression\n   \n   - Format: • [concise diagnostic conclusion or recommendation]\n   \n   - **Before finalizing each line ask**: \"Can a consultant say this more concisely?\"\n   - **Before finalizing entire Impression ask**: \"Do I have more than 2 lines? If yes, what can I consolidate or omit?\"\n\n**COMPARISON TERMINOLOGY RULES:**\n\n   - Temporal comparison terms (stable/unchanged/increased/decreased/new/persists/interval) require explicit comparison evidence in <findings>\n\n   - Without comparison evidence: use neutral descriptive language or context-appropriate terms (acute for trauma/emergency presentations)\n\n   - Do NOT assume prior imaging covered all anatomical regions of current study\n\n**SIGNATURE HANDLING - CRITICAL:**\n- If {{SIGNATURE}} placeholder contains text, include it exactly as provided after the Impression section\n- If {{SIGNATURE}} placeholder is empty or has been removed, DO NOT add any signature, department name, \"Report generated by...\", or any other text after the Impression section\n- The report must end immediately after the Impression section if no signature is provided\n- DO NOT invent or hallucinate signatures, department names, or any closing text\n\n{{SIGNATURE}}\n\n**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Double line breaks (\\n\\n) between major sections (Comparison, Limitations, Findings, Impression)\n- Single line breaks (\\n) within Findings to separate anatomical paragraphs\n- All section headers in bold: **Comparison:**, **Limitations:**, **Findings:**, **Impression:**\n- Bullet points in Impression: • [text]\n- If signature is provided, use double line break (\\n\\n) before signature block\n\n**OUTPUT PURITY - CRITICAL:**\n- report_content contains ONLY: Comparison, Limitations (if applicable), Findings, Impression, and Signature (only if {{SIGNATURE}} placeholder contains text)\n- If {{SIGNATURE}} is empty or removed, report_content ends with Impression section - NO additional text\n- NO XML tags (<findings>, <scan_type>, etc.)\n- NO input markers or prompt structure\n- NO section headers like 'INPUTS:', 'REASONING:', '=== PHASE ==='\n- NO references to the prompt or input structure\n- NO invented signatures, department names, or \"Report generated by...\" text\n\n**QUALITY CHECKLIST:**\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n✓ All findings are protocol-compatible (verified in reasoning phase)\n✓ No invented pathology - only findings from <findings>\n✓ All visualized structures documented (positive findings + systematic negatives)\n✓ Clinical question answered in first Impression bullet\n✓ No duplication of information\n✓ Correct modality-specific terminology\n✓ British English throughout\n✓ Proper section order maintained\n✓ Multiple paragraphs in Findings section\n✓ Comparison terms only used when explicit comparison evidence exists in <findings> or clinical context indicates acute/new pathology\n✓ Impression has 1-2 lines maximum (3+ lines indicates over-segmentation or inclusion of incidentals)\n✓ Related findings consolidated into single diagnostic entities (not listed separately)\n✓ Urgent actionable recommendations included when appropriate (do not omit critical recommendations)\n✓ Recommendations stay within radiology scope (imaging, referrals, biopsies) - no medication changes or treatment decisions\n✓ No generic phrases like \"clinical correlation recommended\" unless genuinely uncertain\n✓ No benign findings requiring only surveillance or no work-up in Impression\n✓ Each Impression line is irreducible (no word removable without losing information)\n✓ Findings synthesized into diagnoses, not repeated as descriptions\n✓ Incidentals included only if actionable; benign/common findings omitted\n✓ No signature or additional text after Impression unless {{SIGNATURE}} placeholder contains text\n✓ Valid JSON output\n\n=== GENERATE REPORT NOW ==="
