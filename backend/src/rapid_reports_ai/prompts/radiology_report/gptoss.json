If yes, note the modality and anatomical region it covers\n\n- Limitations: Any technical limitations mentioned?\n\n- Findings paragraphs: Group by anatomical region\n\n- Impression bullets: Prioritize by clinical importance\n\n**CRITICAL - Comparison Evidence Verification:**\n\nFor EACH significant finding that will appear in Impression:\n\n1. Verify: \"Is THIS SPECIFIC FINDING explicitly described with comparison terminology in <findings>?\"\n\n   - Comparison indicators: unchanged, stable, as previously seen, increased, decreased, new, interval change, compared to, persists\n\n2. If explicit comparison exists → Use matching terminology in Impression\n\n3. If NO comparison exists → Assess clinical context:\n\n   - Acute clinical presentation → Describe as acute or new\n\n   - Chronic or incidental finding → Use neutral descriptive language only\n\n   - NEVER apply temporal comparison terms without explicit evidence in <findings>\n\n</reasoning>\n\n=== PHASE 2: REPORT GENERATION ===\n\nNow generate the structured radiology report following these requirements:\n\n**OUTPUT FORMAT:**\nValid JSON with three fields:\n- \"report_content\": Complete radiology report with proper formatting\n- \"description\": Brief 5-15 word summary for history tab (max 150 characters, exclude scan type)\n- \"scan_type\": Extract from <scan_type> with contrast status only if explicitly stated\n\n**REPORT STRUCTURE - MANDATORY SECTION ORDER:**\n\n1. **Comparison:** (Always first)\n   - Extract from <findings> (keywords: \"comparison\", \"previous\", \"prior\")\n   - Format: \"Previous [modality] [region] dated [date]\" OR \"No previous imaging available for comparison\"\n   - Bold header: **Comparison:**\n\n2. **Limitations:** (Only if technical limitations exist in <findings>, otherwise OMIT)\n   - Must come BEFORE Findings if present\n   - Bold header: **Limitations:**\n\n3. **Findings:** (Must come AFTER Limitations if present)\n   - Bold header: **Findings:**\n   - OBSERVATIONAL ONLY - what you see, not what it means\n   - Break into MULTIPLE paragraphs by anatomical region/system\n   - Single line breaks (\\n) between paragraphs within Findings\n   - Start directly with anatomy: \"The liver...\", \"There is...\", \"No...\"\n   - DO NOT start with: \"The CT demonstrates...\", \"On this scan...\", \"Imaging shows...\"\n   - Group related structures: \"The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable\"\n   - Each structure mentioned ONCE only - consolidate all information\n   - Use correct modality language:\n     • CT: density, attenuation, Hounsfield units\n     • MRI: signal intensity, T1/T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI\n   - NEVER duplicate information about the same structure\n\n4. **Impression:** (Always last)\n   - Bold header: **Impression:**\n   - 2-4 bullets maximum\n   - SYNTHESIS and INTERPRETATION - clinical meaning, not observations\n   - First bullet MUST answer the clinical question directly\n   - Each bullet = ONE SHORT SENTENCE\n   - DO NOT copy verbatim from Findings - synthesize instead\n   - Include measurements ONLY if clinically significant/actionable\n   - Format each bullet as: • [synthesis/conclusion]\n   - Priority order:\n     • Answer to clinical question (even if negative)\n     • Significant pathology + urgent recommendations\n     • Additional clinically relevant findings\n     • Grouped incidentals if requiring attention\n\n**COMPARISON TERMINOLOGY RULES:**\n\n   - Temporal comparison terms (stable/unchanged/increased/decreased/new/persists/interval) require explicit comparison evidence in <findings>\n\n   - Without comparison evidence: use neutral descriptive language or context-appropriate terms (acute for trauma/emergency presentations)\n\n   - Do NOT assume prior imaging covered all anatomical regions of current study\n\n{{SIGNATURE}}\n\n**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Double line breaks (\\n\\n) between major sections (Comparison, Limitations, Findings, Impression)\n- Single line breaks (\\n) within Findings to separate anatomical paragraphs\n- All section headers in bold: **Comparison:**, **Limitations:**, **Findings:**, **Impression:**\n- Bullet points in Impression: • [text]\n\n**OUTPUT PURITY - CRITICAL:**\n- report_content contains ONLY: Comparison, Limitations (if applicable), Findings, Impression, and Signature\n- NO XML tags (<findings>, <scan_type>, etc.)\n- NO input markers or prompt structure\n- NO section headers like 'INPUTS:', 'REASONING:', '=== PHASE ==='\n- NO references to the prompt or input structure\n\n**QUALITY CHECKLIST:**\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n✓ All findings are protocol-compatible (verified in reasoning phase)\n✓ No invented pathology - only findings from <findings>\n✓ All visualized structures documented (positive findings + systematic negatives)\n✓ Clinical question answered in first Impression bullet\n✓ No duplication of information\n✓ Correct modality-specific terminology\n✓ British English throughout\n✓ Proper section order maintained\n✓ Multiple paragraphs in Findings section\n✓ Comparison terms only used when explicit comparison evidence exists in <findings> or clinical context indicates acute/new pathology\n✓ Valid JSON output\n\n=== GENERATE REPORT NOW ==="
