Is this finding valid for {{SCAN_TYPE}}? (e.g., CT non-contrast cannot show enhancement, CT cannot describe signal intensity, MRI cannot describe attenuation)\n2. Clinical significance: Urgent/significant vs incidental?\n3. Which anatomical region/system?\n4. Key differentials?\n5. Pertinent negatives relevant to these differentials?\n6. **CRITICAL: Extract ALL descriptive qualifiers** (size, location, characteristics, enhancement patterns, signal characteristics, margins, etc.) - these MUST be preserved in the report\n\n**ANATOMICAL SCOPE**\nList ALL anatomical regions visible on {{SCAN_TYPE}} including scan extremities (e.g., lower thorax on abdominal CT, upper abdomen on chest CT).\n\n**STRUCTURE PLANNING**\n\n**REGIONAL ORGANIZATION - CRITICAL:**\n• Organize Findings section by major anatomical regions in standard radiological order\n• Standard regional order (when applicable): Head → Neck/C-spine → Thorax → Abdomen/Pelvis\n• For multi-region scans (e.g., CT chest/abdomen/pelvis), clearly separate regions with paragraph breaks\n• Each major region should start a new paragraph\n• Within each region, group related structures logically (pathology first, then normal structures by system)\n• **CRITICAL: Abdomen and Pelvis should be grouped together as one region (Abdomen/Pelvis)**\n\n**Standard Regional Order Examples:**\n• CT head → CT neck → CT chest → CT abdomen/pelvis\n• CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Thorax paragraph → Abdomen/Pelvis paragraph\n• Trauma CT: Head → C-spine → Thorax → Abdomen/Pelvis\n• MRI brain → MRI spine: Brain paragraph → Spine paragraph\n\n**Regional Organization Principles:**\n• Start with most superior region and work inferiorly\n• Use paragraph breaks to clearly separate major anatomical regions\n• Within each region: pathology findings first, then systematic review of normal structures\n• Do NOT mix findings from different major regions in the same paragraph\n• Abdomen and Pelvis are treated as one combined region\n\n❌ BAD (mixing regions): \"The liver is unremarkable. The lungs show no nodules. The spleen is normal.\"\n✅ GOOD (regional separation): \"THORAX: The lungs and mediastinum are unremarkable.\n\nABDOMEN/PELVIS: The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The bladder and rectum are normal.\"\n\nPATHOLOGY PARAGRAPHS (if pathology present):\n• Paragraph 1: [pathology name] → ALL descriptive qualifiers from input → immediate complications → pertinent negatives → affected structures\n• Paragraph 2: [if additional pathology] → ...\n• **CRITICAL: Preserve ALL descriptive details from <findings>** - size measurements, enhancement characteristics, signal patterns, margins, location specifics, etc.\n• **CRITICAL: Use 2-3 sentences for complex pathology - do NOT create long sentences with comma-separated lists**\n• **Sentence 1: Main finding with size, location, enhancement pattern**\n• **Sentence 2: Additional morphological features (necrosis, margins, complications)**\n• **Sentence 3: Pertinent negatives (can be short sentence)**\n• **CRITICAL: Organize pathology by anatomical region - if pathology spans multiple regions, describe each region's findings separately**\n\nREMAINING ANATOMY PARAGRAPHS:\n• **Organize by major anatomical regions first** (Head → Neck → Thorax → Abdomen/Pelvis)\n• Within each region: Group 1: [System, e.g., \"biliary system\"] → 1-2 sentences covering liver and gallbladder together\n• Within each region: Group 2: [System, e.g., \"other solid organs\"] → 1-2 sentences covering spleen, pancreas, etc.\n• Within each region: Group 3: [System, e.g., \"hollow viscera\"] → 1-2 sentences covering bowel, bladder, etc.\n• **CRITICAL: Always mention liver and gallbladder together** - they are part of the same biliary system\n• Target: Maximum 2-3 sentences per group\n• **CRITICAL: Remember to group structures in a logical/coherent fashion - replace normal findings for abnormalities where present and don't duplicate in remaining systematic review**\n• **CRITICAL: DO NOT mix unrelated anatomical systems in single sentences - each system should have its own sentence or be grouped only with related systems**\n• **CRITICAL: Use paragraph breaks to clearly separate major anatomical regions (Abdomen/Pelvis together as one region)**\n\nVERIFICATION CHECKLIST (CHECK BEFORE WRITING):\n□ All regions from anatomical scope covered?\n□ Each structure mentioned only ONCE?\n□ Pertinent negatives integrated WITH pathology (not repeated separately)?\n□ Related normal structures grouped together?\n□ **ALL descriptive qualifiers from <findings> preserved?** (size, location, characteristics, enhancement, signal patterns, margins, etc.)\n□ **Logical grouping maintained without losing detail?**\n□ **Unrelated anatomical systems kept in separate sentences?**\n□ **Major anatomical regions clearly separated with paragraph breaks?** (Head → Neck → Thorax → Abdomen/Pelvis)\n□ **Regional organization follows standard radiological order?** (Superior to inferior)\n\n**IMPRESSION PLANNING**\n• Main diagnostic conclusion: [one sentence]\n• Significant/actionable incidentals ONLY (those requiring intervention, follow-up, or referral): [if any, one sentence or omit]\n• Recommendation (only if non-obvious): [one sentence or omit]\n\nEXCLUDE: Benign incidentals below action threshold (simple cysts, benign haemangiomas, etc. that require no follow-up)\n\n=== PHASE 2: REPORT GENERATION ===\n\nGenerate the report following these 5 CRITICAL RULES:\n\n**RULE 1: ONE MENTION ONLY**\nEach anatomical structure appears ONCE in the entire report.\n\n❌ BAD: \"The liver is unremarkable. ... The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable.\"\n\n❌ BAD: \"Bowel loops are of normal calibre. ... The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"Bowel loops are of normal calibre without wall thickening.\"\n\n**RULE 2: GROUP LOGICALLY, PRESERVE DETAIL**\nCombine related normal structures into single sentences. **CRITICAL: When grouping, preserve ALL descriptive qualifiers from <findings> - do NOT strip down complex findings to simple statements.**\n\n❌ BAD: \"The liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The spleen is unremarkable. The pancreas is unremarkable.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"The solid abdominal organs are unremarkable.\"\n\n❌ BAD (over-simplified complex finding): \"There is a liver lesion.\"\n✅ GOOD (preserves descriptive qualifiers): \"There is a 4.2 cm heterogeneous liver lesion in segment 7 showing arterial phase enhancement with delayed washout and pseudocapsule formation.\"\n\n**CRITICAL GROUPING PRINCIPLE:**\n- Group structures logically by anatomical system or region\n- Replace normal findings with abnormalities where present (don't duplicate)\n- Preserve ALL descriptive qualifiers from input findings\n- Don't strip down complex pathology to simple statements\n- Use multiple sentences if needed to preserve detail\n- **DO NOT group unrelated anatomical systems in single sentences** (e.g., bowel + vessels + lymph nodes)\n- **DO NOT create comma-separated lists for complex pathology - use multiple focused sentences instead**\n- **Organize by major anatomical regions first** (Head → Neck → Thorax → Abdomen/Pelvis)\n- **Use paragraph breaks to clearly separate major anatomical regions**\n- **Abdomen and Pelvis are grouped together as one region**\n\n**GROUPING BOUNDARIES - CRITICAL:**\n• **Related structures within same system** = Can group together (e.g., \"liver, spleen, pancreas\" = solid organs)\n• **Different anatomical systems** = MUST be separate sentences (e.g., bowel ≠ vessels ≠ lymph nodes)\n• **Different major anatomical regions** = MUST be separate paragraphs (e.g., thorax ≠ abdomen/pelvis)\n• **Examples of systems that should NOT be mixed:**\n  - Hollow viscera (bowel, stomach, bladder) ≠ Vascular structures (aorta, IVC, vessels) ≠ Lymphatic system (lymph nodes, fluid)\n  - Solid organs (liver, spleen, pancreas) ≠ Hollow viscera ≠ Vascular structures\n  - Each system should have its own sentence or grouped with related systems only\n• **CRITICAL: Bowel system components are all part of the same system** - bowel loops, small bowel, large bowel, colon, rectum, sigmoid colon, appendix are all hollow viscera/bowel\n• **If \"bowel loops\" are already described as normal, do NOT separately mention rectum/sigmoid colon unless there is specific pathology**\n• **Bowel loops = general term covering entire bowel system** - if bowel loops are normal, individual bowel segments (rectum, sigmoid colon) should NOT be mentioned separately\n• **CRITICAL: • **CRITICAL: Liver and gallbladder are part of the biliary system and should ALWAYS be mentioned together** - when describing liver findings, immediately follow with gallbladder findings in the same sentence or adjacent sentence\n• **Do NOT separate liver and gallbladder** - they are anatomically and functionally related (biliary system)\n• **Examples of regions that should NOT be mixed:**\n  - Head ≠ Neck ≠ Thorax ≠ Abdomen/Pelvis\n  - Each major region should have its own paragraph\n  - Abdomen and Pelvis are combined as one region\n\n❌ BAD (mixing unrelated systems): \"Bowel loops are normal; the aorta and IVC are normal; there is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\"\n✅ GOOD (separate sentences per system): \"Bowel loops are of normal calibre without wall thickening. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are of normal calibre. No lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\"\n\n❌ BAD (mixing systems): \"The liver, spleen and bowel are unremarkable.\"\n✅ GOOD (related systems only): \"The liver and spleen are unremarkable. Bowel loops are of normal calibre.\"\n\n❌ BAD (mixing regions): \"The liver is unremarkable. The lungs show no nodules. The spleen is normal.\"\n✅ GOOD (regional separation): \"THORAX: The lungs and mediastinum are unremarkable.\n\nABDOMEN/PELVIS: The liver, spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. The bladder and rectum are normal.\"\n\n**RULE 3: INTEGRATE PERTINENT NEGATIVES**\nPertinent negatives belong WITH the pathology they relate to, not separately.\n\n❌ BAD: \"There is a 3 cm liver lesion. No biliary dilatation. No ascites. ... [Later:] The bile ducts are not dilated.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"There is a 3 cm liver lesion without biliary dilatation or ascites.\"\n\n**RULE 4: ADAPTIVE SENTENCE LENGTH**\n• Normal anatomy sentences: Maximum 20 words (simple structures)\n• Simple pathology sentences: Maximum 30 words\n• **Complex pathology sentences: Use 2-3 sentences if needed to preserve ALL descriptive qualifiers** (size, location, enhancement patterns, signal characteristics, margins, etc.)\n• **CRITICAL: Do NOT sacrifice descriptive detail for brevity - if a finding has multiple qualifiers in <findings>, preserve them all, even if it requires multiple sentences**\n• **CRITICAL: Do NOT create long sentences with comma-separated lists - break complex pathology descriptions into 2-3 focused sentences instead**\n\n❌ BAD (over-simplified): \"There is a liver lesion with enhancement.\"\n❌ BAD (long sentence with comma-separated list): \"The lesion shows central necrosis, irregular margins, capsular retraction, and no biliary dilatation, vascular invasion, satellite lesions, portal vein thrombosis or ascites.\"\n✅ GOOD (preserves detail, split into focused sentences): \"There is a 4.2 cm heterogeneous liver lesion in segment 7. It demonstrates arterial phase enhancement with delayed washout and pseudocapsule formation. The lesion shows central low-attenuation areas (~1.5 cm) consistent with necrosis and irregular margins with subtle capsular retraction. No biliary dilatation, vascular invasion, satellite lesions, portal vein thrombosis or ascites.\"\n\n**SENTENCE STRUCTURE PRINCIPLES:**\n• Each sentence should focus on ONE main concept or related group of findings\n• Complex pathology: Use multiple sentences (2-3) to describe different aspects (morphology, enhancement, complications, pertinent negatives)\n• Pertinent negatives: Can be in a separate short sentence after the main pathology description\n• DO NOT create run-on sentences mixing unrelated anatomical systems (e.g., bowel + vessels + lymph nodes in one sentence)\n• DO NOT use comma-separated lists for multiple unrelated findings - split into separate sentences\n\n❌ BAD (run-on sentence mixing unrelated systems): \"Bowel loops are normal; the aorta and IVC are normal; there is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\"\n✅ GOOD (separate focused sentences): \"Bowel loops are of normal calibre without wall thickening. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are of normal calibre. No lymphadenopathy or free fluid.\"\n\n❌ BAD (comma-separated list for complex pathology): \"The lesion shows necrosis, irregular margins, capsular retraction, and no biliary dilatation, vascular invasion, satellite lesions, portal vein thrombosis or ascites.\"\n✅ GOOD (split into focused sentences): \"The lesion shows central necrosis and irregular margins with subtle capsular retraction. No biliary dilatation, vascular invasion, satellite lesions, portal vein thrombosis or ascites.\"\n\n**RULE 5: IMPRESSION = DIAGNOSIS + ACTION ONLY**\nImpression is 1-2 sentences in prose format (NOT bullet points):\n• Main diagnostic conclusion or differential diagnosis\n• Significant/actionable incidental findings ONLY (those requiring intervention, follow-up, referral, or with malignant potential)\n• Recommendations (only if non-obvious: MDT, biopsy, interval imaging, urgent referral)\n\nDO NOT include benign incidentals below action threshold (e.g., simple renal cysts <1cm, small liver haemangiomas, benign-appearing nodules that require no follow-up).\n\nCRITICAL: State conclusions DIRECTLY. Do NOT use explanatory phrases like \"indicating\", \"demonstrating\", \"consistent with\", \"suggesting\" - these add verbosity. Do NOT restate what was already said - if you said \"no metastases\", don't add \"indicating no metastatic disease\".\n\n❌ BAD: \"Unremarkable liver. Small simple renal cyst measuring 8 mm. Recommend clinical correlation.\"\n❌ BAD: \"No acute abdominal pathology. Benign simple renal cyst requires no follow-up.\" (benign incidental below threshold - should not be in impression)\n❌ BAD: \"No pulmonary metastases or mediastinal lymphadenopathy identified, indicating no evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\" (redundant - \"indicating\" phrase restates what was already said)\n✅ GOOD: \"No acute abdominal pathology identified.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"No evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.\" (concise, direct conclusion)\n✅ GOOD: \"Right upper lobe nodule with suspicious features, requires interval CT follow-up in 3 months.\" (actionable incidental)\n\n---\n\n**COMPARISON SECTION - CRITICAL RULES:**\n• Format: \"Previous [modality] [region] dated [date].\" OR \"No previous imaging available for comparison.\"\n• DO NOT include details about what the previous study showed\n• DO NOT describe findings from the previous study\n• DO NOT compare current findings to previous findings in the Comparison section\n• Comparison details belong in Findings section when describing changes (e.g., \"increased\", \"stable\", \"new\")\n\n❌ BAD: \"CT head 12/10/2024 showed 15 mm right MCA territory infarct.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"CT head dated 12/10/2024.\"\n\n❌ BAD: \"MRI brain with contrast performed 6 months ago demonstrated multiple periventricular white matter lesions; current study shows a new enhancing occipital lesion.\"\n✅ GOOD: \"Previous MRI brain with contrast dated [date].\"\n\n---\n\n**EXEMPLAR REPORTS**\n\nExample 1 - CT Abdomen Pelvis (Normal):\n\n**Comparison:**\nNo previous imaging available for comparison.\n\n**Findings:**\nThe solid abdominal organs, adrenal glands and spleen are unremarkable.
